## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate UI.
- **Custom Functionality**: Implements specific features as per the assessment requirements.
- **User-orientated development**: Menu buttons are not links. I made them with scripts to be able to click without aiming the text.

## Known bugs
- **Jumpy menu**: When click the menu the Dark mode button updates its' state and the menu jumps.
- **Dashoboard on the narrow display**: Very narrow display brakes the dashboard a little bit.
- **Location services are not developed**: Default city is Waterford. Not a bug. Just lack of time.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- 11ty
- Copilot (only to generate the documentation for the functions and a part of this readme).

- Dev ToolBox HTML/CSS Formatter
- Bulma >:-V

## From the author
As a student diving into web development and driving himself crazy, this project gave me a lot of discovery and challenges.


I had to make CSS injections across different elements because Bulma simply does't work or doesnt make sence at all. This unexpected "twist" taught me valuable lessons in troubleshooting. I wasted hours trying to find small mistakes...
I aimed to make a site that not only fetches weather data but also is a user-friendly with a clean, intuitive interface.
After bulma experiance im slowly become a fan of Flexbox!

Thank you for visiting, and I hope this site will demonstrate my ability to get data from datastorage and user-oriented development. I know I need to improove my site structure and I will. We all are learners here!
I have never created sites before so for me it is a really good result.

This site has been in development from 29.04.2025 to 12.05.2025 because I wasted 2 weeks trying to make the index page with bulma and had to finish it 1 week earlier because I still have another assessment to start. I have never learned so much in my life in a such small period of time.
And have never created sites before so for me it is a really good result.
Stressful, hard, but fun! ðŸ˜Š
