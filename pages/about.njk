    <p class="title has-text-centered">Welcome to my weather project!</p></br>
    <p>
    As a student diving into web development and driving himself crazy,
      this project gave me a lot of discovery and challenges.</p></br>
    <p>I had to make CSS injections across
      different elements because Bulma simply doesn't work or doesnt make sense at all. This unexpected "twist" taught me valuable lessons in
      troubleshooting. I wasted hours trying to find small mistakes...</br>I aimed to make a site that not only fetches weather data
      but also is a user-friendly with a clean, intuitive interface.
    </br>
      After bulma experiance im slowly become a fan of Flexbox!
    </br></br>
    Thank you for visiting, and
      I hope this site will demonstrate my ability to get data from datastorage and user-oriented development.
      I know I need to improove my site structure and I will. We all are learners here!</br> I have never created sites before so for me it is a really good result.</br></br>
      
      This site has been in development from 29.04.2025 to 12.05.2025 because I wasted 2 weeks trying to make the index page with bulma and had to finish it 1 week earlier because I still have another assessment to start.
      I have never learned so much in my life in a such small period of time. </br>And have never created sites before so for me it is a really good result.</br>Stressful, hard, but fun! ðŸ˜Š
