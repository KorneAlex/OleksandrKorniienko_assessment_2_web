<li><strong>Jumpy menu</strong>: When click the menu the Dark mode button updates its' state and the menu jumps.</li>

<h2>From the author</h2>
<p>As a student diving into web development and driving himself crazy, this project gave me a lot of discovery and challenges.</p>
<p>I had to make CSS injections across different elements because Bulma simply does't work or doesnt make sence at all. This unexpected &quot;twist&quot; taught me valuable lessons in troubleshooting. I wasted hours trying to find small mistakes...
I aimed to make a site that not only fetches weather data but also is a user-friendly with a clean, intuitive interface.
After bulma experiance im slowly become a fan of Flexbox!</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting, and I hope this site will demonstrate my ability to get data from datastorage and user-oriented development. I know I need to improove my site structure and I will. We all are learners here!
I have never created sites before so for me it is a really good result.</p>
<h2>This site has been in development from 29.04.2025 to 12.05.2025 because I wasted 2 weeks trying to make the index page with bulma and had to finish it 1 week earlier because I still have another assessment to start. I have never learned so much in my life in a such small period of time.
And have never created sites before so for me it is a really good result.
Stressful, hard, but fun! ðŸ˜Š</h2>
